I am a PhD candidate in Political Science with an emphasis in Black Studies at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/). My research centers on race and politics in the United States, with a focus on Black political thought, ethnic nationalism, and political identity formation.

My work examines how racial and ethnic identities shape political behavior, coalition-building, and engagement with social movements. I am particularly interested in how younger generations of Black Americans navigate political independence, how digital platforms mediate racial boundary work, and how nationalist rhetoric circulates through popular culture. I also study environmental justice in the context of carbon capture and storage policy.

I hold an M.A. in Political Science from UC Santa Barbara and a B.A. in Political Science with a minor in Philosophy from California State University, Bakersfield, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude.
